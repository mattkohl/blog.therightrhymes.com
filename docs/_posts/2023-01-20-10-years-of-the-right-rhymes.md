I published my first batch of entries in The Right Rhymes[^1] hip-hop dictionary in 2013. To mark this 10-year anniversary, here's a brief history of the project.

Prior to 2013, I worked for many years as a researcher on the Oxford English Dictionary[^2] (OED), part of their ongoing revision efforts. It was a fun gig, & I learned a lot about language & lexicography.

My remit included assessing suggestions for new words (i.e. senses not yet covered by the OED) against criteria intended to signal sufficient evidence to merit inclusion in the dictionary. By searching online databases of published text (Newspaper Archive[^3], Google Books, JSTOR, etc.)

Success meant graduating the suggestion into the drafting process; upon failure, we tabled the suggestion with its evidence for a subsequent review (typically years later). 

Once I'd been doing new words assessment for a while, I developed an intuition for likely gaps in OED coverage, & I carried this with me in everyday life outside of work. Reading books, watching television, & even chatting with friends, would invariably trigger my thinking, "have we got that in the dictionary?" Few activities were more productive for this than listening to hip-hop music.

Over time, many of the OED coverage gaps I'd surfaced by listening hip-hop music,
